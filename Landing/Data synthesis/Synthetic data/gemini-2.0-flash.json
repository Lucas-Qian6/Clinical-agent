For example, focusing on your senses--what you can see, hear, touch, taste, and smell--can help redirect your mind away from distressing thoughts.

As we go through this process, it's important to be kind to yourself and recognize the progress you make, no matter how small it seems. You are taking proactive steps towards change, and that's a significant achievement in itself. Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like to start with, or if there are any particular decision-making scenarios you find less daunting to tackle initially.",

It allows you to practice making decisions in a low-pressure setting. As you work on this, try to be mindful of any thoughts or feelings that come up and how you handle them. By doing this, you'll gain insights into the patterns that might be influencing your decision-making. Remember, you're not alone in this--I'm here to support you along the way.

When it's time to decide, you can quickly choose from these options rather than starting from scratch. This reduces the number of decisions, making the process feel less overwhelming. You can also set a time limit, like giving yourself five minutes to choose, which can help prevent overthinking. How does that approach sound to you?",

It's understandable to feel conflicted when you're trying to support them through their challenges. One approach we could explore together is the idea of setting some clear boundaries and responses to their behavior, which might help you feel more in control and also provide a consistent framework for them. How does that sound to you?",

One strategy could be to involve them in the process, discussing what both of you think is fair and why certain boundaries exist.

It might help to balance the conversation with expressions of understanding and support, making sure they know you're there to help them succeed and not just to discipline.

One approach you might consider is planning these discussions at a time when both of you are more relaxed, rather than in the heat of the moment.

Preparation can certainly make a difference, but it's also okay to acknowledge when things aren't perfect. You're doing your best, and that's an important step.

The sense of guilt can be overwhelming, but it's important to remember that you're not to blame for what happened. Have you considered trying a technique called exposure exercises?

One approach we can explore is cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying and challenging these anxious thoughts to see if there are alternative, balanced ways to view the situation.

    "chosen": "That's a great question, and your concern is very valid. Cognitive restructuring often involves identifying these recurring worries, evaluating the evidence for and against them, and then developing more balanced thoughts. We can start by identifying a specific thought that's causing you distress and work through it together.

Then, think about what evidence suggests it might not be as serious as you're fearing, such as past experiences or medical advice you've already received. Once you've weighed the evidence, let's see if you can come up with a more balanced perspective, like, \"I have some discomfort, but I've taken steps to consult with a doctor and I'm actively addressing my health.\" How does this process feel for you?",

    "chosen": "Absolutely, it does become more manageable with practice. It's quite common to focus on worst-case scenarios, but by consistently using cognitive restructuring, you can begin to shift your perspective over time. Developing this skill can help reduce the immediate need for reassurance, as you'll become more confident in evaluating your thoughts. Remember, it's a process, and taking these steps is already a positive move forward. Are you comfortable continuing to practice this approach together?",

Let's examine this thought by considering the evidence for and against it, and see if there might be another way to view it.

As part of cognitive restructuring, you might find it helpful to remind yourself of these other possibilities when your initial thought arises. Over time, this could help reduce some of your frustration. Would you be open to practicing this during your commutes this week and see how it affects your experience?",

    "chosen": "That's an excellent start, and it's perfectly okay that it doesn't eliminate the pain entirely. With practice, grounding can become a more automatic and effective tool for you. Let's plan to continue exploring and reinforcing this and possibly other strategies in future sessions.

    "chosen": "Thank you for sharing that, Jamie. It sounds like the thought \"it will get worse and ruin my appearance\" triggered a lot of anxiety for you.

For example, you might ask yourself, \"What evidence do I have that it will necessarily get worse?\" or \"Could leaving it alone actually help it heal better?\" We can explore these alternatives now, and you can practice them when you notice this thought. Does this approach resonate with you?",

    "chosen": "Thank you for sharing that example. It sounds like those thoughts really contribute to your anxiety. Let's try to challenge them.

    "chosen": "It's understandable that the worry doesn't just disappear, even when looking at the evidence. Taking note of the positive feedback you've received is a great start, and it's a reminder of your capabilities. As for the worries, one technique we can try is to ask yourself what the most realistic outcome is, rather than focusing on worst-case scenarios. How often do those fears actually come true, and how can you prepare yourself for various possibilities without letting the fear take over? How does exploring these questions feel to you?",

    "chosen": "It's definitely a challenge, but recognizing that the worst-case rarely happens is a big step forward. Practicing this shift in perspective can gradually help reduce the anxiety. Let's add this to your action plan\u2014each time you notice those thoughts creeping in, try to remind yourself of the realistic outcomes and reflect on past experiences.

It sounds like driving by yourself has been a significant source of anxiety, and that might be making you feel more dependent on others than you'd prefer. Let's set a goal for this session to explore this driving anxiety further and see if we can identify some thoughts or behaviors that might be contributing to it. How does that sound to you?",

Let's try a CBT technique called cognitive restructuring. This involves examining those thoughts more closely and challenging them with evidence or alternative perspectives.

It's perfectly normal for it to feel challenging at first, but with practice, it can become a more natural part of how you address those anxious thoughts.

Acknowledging these successes can be incredibly empowering and can help challenge the belief that you won't be able to handle things.

    "chosen": "Thank you for sharing that specific example. It sounds like the thought \"What if I lost control and fell?\" triggered a sense of panic and made you feel embarrassed.

Let's work on creating a more balanced thought. For example, when the thought arises, you might remind yourself, \"I've always been able to keep control before, and it's unlikely to change.\" How does that alternative thought feel to you?

It's important to remember that change is a process and doesn't have to happen all at once. Feeling apprehensive is natural, but the fact that you're here and considering new ways of thinking shows strength in itself. Let's take this one step at a time.

It can be challenging, but with small, consistent steps, we can work towards creating a shift in how you view yourself. Throughout this process, it's important to be patient and gentle with yourself. Let's begin by identifying some specific thoughts or situations when these feelings of shame and worthlessness tend to arise.

Let's start by picking one specific recent situation where you felt this way, perhaps in a social setting. We can then look at the specific thoughts that came up for you during that time. Once we identify those thoughts, I'll guide you through a process to gently challenge them. This might involve asking questions like, \"Is there evidence that challenges this thought?\" or \"Are there other perspectives I might consider?\" This approach can lead to new, more balanced ways of thinking over time.

First, try to recall the specific automatic thoughts that came up when you were in the meeting. What went through your mind at that moment? As we explore these thoughts, we'll work on identifying any patterns and evidence that support or challenge these beliefs. By doing so, we hope to find a more balanced perspective.

The thoughts, \"I'm going to mess up,\" and \"Everyone else is doing better than me,\" can be incredibly powerful and overwhelming. They can make us feel anxious and less capable, as you've experienced. Let's explore these thoughts together. One way to approach this is by examining their accuracy. For example, we might ask ourselves, \"What evidence do I have that supports or contradicts these thoughts?\" and \"Have there been times when I performed well or received positive feedback?\" By identifying alternative perspectives and gathering evidence, we can start to see these situations in a more balanced light. How does that process feel to you? Would you like to try finding some evidence either supporting or challenging these thoughts?",

It's common for negative thoughts to be more prominent, but remembering these positive instances is key in challenging and reshaping those negative beliefs. Let's try to bring some of those positive moments into focus. Can you recall a specific instance when you felt proud of your contribution or received positive feedback? By identifying these examples, we can start to build a more balanced view of your abilities and experiences. Once you've identified one, we can work on anchoring that positive memory to challenge the automatic thought that arises during meetings. How does that sound to you?",

When you notice these doubts and feelings of guilt, what kind of evidence do you find yourself focusing on?

I started feeling very anxious and then just kept thinking about how it would throw off my dinner and evening workout. I felt really tense and restless, almost like everything was spiraling out of control.",
    "chosen": "Thank you for sharing those details, Jamie. From what you've described, it seems the unexpected change triggered a lot of anxious thoughts and feelings of losing control, which then affected your focus for the rest of the day. Let\u2019s try a technique called cognitive restructuring. It involves examining and challenging those automatic thoughts. For instance, how might we reframe the thought of missing lunch in a way that reduces its impact on your day? Can you think of an alternative way to interpret that situation?",

By reminding yourself that one disrupted meal doesn't define your entire day, you open up space for flexibility and lessen the anxiety around it. Let\u2019s practice this kind of reframing regularly so it becomes a more automatic response. How do you feel about trying this approach the next time you face a similar situation, and perhaps even noting down your thoughts and feelings when it happens?",

Hold the breath for a moment, then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. 5. As you breathe, try to focus your attention on the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body.

Here's how it works: 1. **5 things you can see:** Look around and notice five things you can see, whether it's the seat in front of you, trees passing by, or anything else within sight. 2. **4 things you can touch:** Notice the feeling of the seat under you, the texture of your clothing, the coolness of air conditioning\u2014anything you can physically feel. 3. **3 things you can hear:** Focus on three surrounding sounds, like the hum of the engine, your breathing, or even the sound of your own heartbeat. 4. **2 things you can smell:** If possible, identify two scents around you, such as the car's interior or a nearby air freshener. 5. **1 thing you can taste:** This could be a mint, gum, or just focus on the taste inside your mouth. Would you like to try this exercise during a car ride, and see if it helps to manage your anxiety? Let me know your thoughts or any questions you might have about this technique.",

    "chosen": "It's completely understandable to feel anxious about missing out. This sense of urgency can be quite stressful. How about we explore ways to prioritize notifications and identify which ones truly need immediate attention? This can help in feeling more in control and reducing anxiety.

    "chosen": "Absolutely, it can be difficult to discern what's truly important amidst all the noise. We can work together to create a simple framework for prioritizing and categorizing notifications. Perhaps we could use a three-tier system: urgent, important but not urgent, and less critical.

    "chosen": "Great! Let's start by defining what might fall into each category for you. For \"urgent,\" think of tasks or notifications that require immediate attention. \"Important but not urgent\" could include things that need attention but aren't time-sensitive. Lastly, \"less critical\" could be those that don't require immediate action or that you can delegate. How do you feel about assigning specific notifications to these categories?",
    "rejected": "Okay, great! Just think positive, you'll sort it all out in no time. You should probably just turn off all notifications except for the urgent ones, that's what I do.\n",

    "chosen": "That's a great start, Jamie! By categorizing like this, you can focus on what truly needs your attention and potentially reduce some of the anxiety around missing out. Let's also think about a specific time each day when you can review and act on these priorities. How often and when do you think would work best for you?",

In today's session, would you like to focus on exploring these challenges with your parents, or perhaps look into ways to manage the feeling of being stuck?

    "chosen": "That sounds like a solid plan, Jamie. So, for today's session, let's focus on two main goals: exploring effective communication strategies with your parents to reduce conflicts, and considering steps to move forward from the current feeling of being stuck.

They started saying I always say \"later\" and never do it, which really annoyed me. I snapped back, saying I would if they stopped nagging me all the time. That's when they got really frustrated, and it turned into a bigger argument. It just spiraled from there.",
    "chosen": "Thanks for describing that situation, Jamie. It sounds like the disagreement quickly escalated from a relatively small request to a larger conflict. Let's explore this interaction a bit further. What were you thinking or feeling in that moment when they mentioned \"later\"? And how do you think they felt when you responded the way you did?",

    "chosen": "It's understandable to feel defensive if you perceive criticism, especially if you're already feeling pressured or stuck. Recognizing that your parents might have felt dismissed is an important insight. Let's work on some strategies for those moments. Perhaps we can focus on finding ways to express your needs or feelings more calmly and effectively. How does exploring an alternative communication approach sound to you?",

    "chosen": "Excellent, Jamie. Being open to exploring new communication techniques is a great step forward. Let's practice a specific approach that could help: using \"I\" statements to express your feelings without assigning blame. For example, instead of saying, \"Stop nagging me,\" you might say, \"I feel overwhelmed when I hear reminders too frequently; can we discuss a schedule that works for both of us?\" How does that approach feel to you? Can you think of a situation where you might use it?",

    "prompt": "I've been really overwhelmed. There were some changes at work that I didn't expect, and it threw off my entire schedule. I'm just struggling to regain that sense of control.",
    "chosen": "It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when unexpected changes disrupt your routine. That sense of control is important. One approach that could help is exploring exposure exercises. These involve gradually facing the situations that create stress, in a controlled and safe way, to build resilience. What do you think about trying something like that to help regain balance?",

    "chosen": "It's completely natural to feel apprehensive about facing stressful situations, especially when you value predictability. The goal with exposure exercises is to do this gradually, starting with less intimidating scenarios, building confidence over time. We would move forward at a pace that feels manageable for you. How does that sound in terms of a potential approach to regain a sense of control?",

    "chosen": "That's a solid approach. Starting with smaller changes can make the process feel more manageable. We can create a detailed plan that outlines each step, so you know what's coming up next. This can help in reducing uncertainty and building your confidence gradually. Let me know if you have specific situations in mind where you'd like to start, and we can work on the details together.",

    "chosen": "That sounds like a practical starting point. Adjusting your morning routine incrementally can gently introduce new changes while maintaining a sense of security. We can outline specific aspects of your routine to modify and determine which small changes feel comfortable to try first. This way, you can gradually increase your flexibility without feeling overwhelmed. How does that approach resonate with you?",

Next time you notice these thoughts of paranoia, try asking yourself, \"What would I say to a friend who had this thought?\" This can help create some distance from the automatic thought and develop a new perspective.

It seems like while there are some initial challenges in conversations, you've also received feedback indicating that you are interesting to others once they get to know you. This suggests that the belief of coming off as boring might not entirely reflect the reality.

Let's set a goal for today to focus on exploring those feelings of anger and finding some strategies to manage them better. How does that sound to you? Is there anything else you'd like to add to our goals for this session?",

    "prompt": "That sounds okay. I guess, I just want to feel less trapped by this emotional exhaustion. Let's see what we can do.",
    "chosen": "I hear you. Feeling trapped by emotional exhaustion is challenging, and it's a great step that you want to work on it. Let's start by exploring what typically triggers these feelings of anger for you at work. Once we have a clearer picture, we can think about specific strategies to help you manage them. Does that work for you?",
    "rejected": "\"Great! Just look on the bright side \u2013 at least you have a job, right? Maybe try smiling more; that always helps!\"\n",
    "source": "Final Dialogues"
}
{
    "system": "You are a helpful, empathetic clinical assistant.",
    "prompt": "Yeah, it works. Most of the time, it's the constant stream of complaints and feeling like I can't express how I really feel.",
    "chosen": "It makes sense that dealing with constant complaints without having an outlet for your feelings would lead to frustration. Let's explore this further. Would you say there are certain situations or types of complaints that trigger your anger more than others? And how do you usually respond internally when this happens?",

    "chosen": "It sounds like those interactions make you feel understandably frustrated, especially when you perceive a sense of entitlement. Holding in that frustration can add to the emotional exhaustion you're feeling. Let's consider a couple of strategies. One could be identifying some quick, in-the-moment techniques to help manage that simmering frustration. Another might be finding safe ways to express those feelings later. Which approach do you think might be more helpful, or is there another idea you're considering?",

    "prompt": "I think finding quick techniques to manage the frustration on the spot could be helpful. Anything to prevent it from piling up more.",
    "chosen": "Great, let's focus on that. One technique we could try is a grounding exercise, such as taking a few slow, deep breaths or mentally noting physical sensations around you, like the feeling of your feet on the ground. Another might be using a quick, calming phrase or mantra to remind yourself that you\u2019re handling the situation as best you can. How do these ideas sound to you? Would you like to try one of them now, or is there another technique you\u2019ve heard of that you\u2019d like to explore?",

    "system": "You are a helpful, empathetic clinical assistant.",
    "prompt": "The grounding exercise sounds like a good place to start. I could try focusing on my breathing when I feel the frustration building up.",
    "chosen": "That sounds like a great choice. Focusing on your breathing can be a powerful way to center yourself in the moment. Let\u2019s give it a try. Close your eyes if you\u2019re comfortable, and take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, feeling your belly expand. Then, slowly breathe out through your mouth. We\u2019ll repeat this a few times. When you practice this during your day, aim to do it for a minute or two. How does that feel for you right now?",

    "prompt": "It feels a bit calming, actually. I can see how this might help me take the edge off when things get overwhelming.",
    "chosen": "I'm glad to hear that it feels calming for you. Practicing this breathing technique can create a little pause and help reduce that initial edge of frustration. As part of our action plan, how about you try using this technique a few times throughout your day, and we can check in on how it goes next session? Does that sound workable to you?",

    "chosen": "That sounds really distressing, Jamie. It's understandable that those sensations would cause you to feel anxious. Our bodies can sometimes react strongly to stress, and these physical sensations can be quite unsettling. One effective technique we might try is called exposure exercises, where we gradually face and become more comfortable with these sensations. How do you feel about exploring this approach?",
    "rejected": "    Oh, Jamie, I'm sure it's just stress! Think happy thoughts and focus on the positive; you'll be fine!\n",

    "prompt": "I understand that it might help, but the idea of intentionally experiencing those sensations is really frightening to me. I'm worried that if I face them, it could trigger something dangerous.",
    "chosen": "I hear you, Jamie, and it's completely normal to feel apprehensive about that. Your safety and comfort are always our priority. The idea behind exposure exercises is to help you slowly and gently become less reactive to those sensations by learning they're not dangerous, even if they're uncomfortable. We can take it at your pace and make adjustments as needed to ensure you feel supported throughout the process. Does this approach sound like something you'd want to explore further in a way that feels manageable for you?",

    "chosen": "That's perfectly okay, Jamie. It's important to honor how you're feeling and not rush into anything before you're ready. We can definitely take some time to discuss other ways to support you in managing these feelings, like relaxation techniques or focusing on coping strategies you already find helpful. Whatever you decide, I'm here to support you through it.",

    "chosen": "That sounds like a great plan, Jamie. Relaxation techniques can be really effective in helping to calm both the mind and body. We can explore options like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery to see what resonates with you. Let's focus on finding what helps you feel more at ease. How does that sound to you?",

    "prompt": "That sounds manageable. I'd like to try something like deep breathing to start.",
    "chosen": "Deep breathing is a wonderful choice, Jamie. It's simple yet effective in helping to calm the nervous system. You might start by taking a slow, deep breath in through your nose, holding it gently for a moment, and then slowly exhaling through your mouth. Doing this a few times can help ease some of the tension you\u2019re feeling. Would you like to practice this together now, or does trying it on your own sound better?",

    "chosen": "Of course, Jamie. I'm here with you. Let's start by getting comfortable. You can sit or lie down, whatever feels best. When you're ready, take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs gently. Hold it for a couple of seconds, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. We'll do this a few more times, and feel free to close your eyes if it helps you focus. Remember, there's no rush; just go at your own pace.",

    "prompt": "Okay, I'll give it a try. I'll try to focus on the breath and stay calm.",
    "chosen": "You're doing great, Jamie. Just remember to be gentle with yourself as you practice. The focus is on the breath, and letting go of tension with each exhale. If your mind starts to wander, that's perfectly okay. Just gently bring your attention back to your breathing. You're in control here, and taking this time for yourself is a positive step.

    "chosen": "I hear you, Jamie. It sounds like the thought of encountering large birds is really affecting you, making certain places feel off-limits. Let's identify a couple of goals for our session today. How about we aim to better understand these worries and work on a strategy to manage them? How does that sound to you?",

    "chosen": "It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, and I appreciate you sharing that. Let's work together to explore this fear and see if we can break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. In doing so, we'll consider some techniques that could help reduce its intensity. Does that approach seem doable for you?",

Then, we can analyze the thoughts and feelings you experience in that moment. This will help us understand your reactions and find effective ways to manage them. Is there a specific situation that comes to mind?",

Let's take a moment to explore what specific thoughts pop into your mind when you see them. Identifying these will help us address them more effectively. What do you think might happen when you encounter geese that causes this reaction?",

Then, we can think of some coping strategies you can use if you do encounter them. Would you like to begin by exploring what you know about geese behavior or focus on specific coping strategies?",

One approach could be grounding techniques to manage the immediate anxiety, like deep breathing or focusing on your surroundings. We can also explore maintaining a safe distance and having a clear path away. How do these strategies resonate with you? Would you like to brainstorm any specific actions or alternatives?",

For today\u2019s session, would it be helpful to explore this sense of detachment and look at what's contributing to it? Perhaps we can also identify some small steps that might help shift things.

    "chosen": "That\u2019s understandable, and experiencing a blank or empty mind can be quite unsettling. It might be helpful to consider if there are any subtle feelings or physical sensations accompanying this blankness. Sometimes our emotions can manifest in ways that aren\u2019t immediately obvious. Would you be open to exploring this angle?",

When you find yourself feeling detached, try to notice any physical sensations, even subtle ones, like tension in your body or changes in your posture. This might help bring some awareness to what you\u2019re experiencing. We can also look at ways to gently ground yourself, perhaps through breathing exercises or focusing on your surroundings.

Your thought, \"Why is this happening again?\" suggests there might be underlying beliefs or expectations contributing to the cycle.

From there, we can challenge them by asking questions like: \"What evidence do I have for and against this thought?\" or \"What would I say to a friend who had this same thought?\" How does this process sound to you as a first step?

It's understandable to feel overwhelmed with a new baby, and it's common for new parents to feel this way.

    "chosen": "You're definitely not alone in feeling this way. Many new parents go through similar experiences. It's important to acknowledge that these feelings don't mean you're failing. I'd like us to explore your expectations and the reality of your current situation. We can also look at specific thoughts that might be contributing to how you're feeling. We can then work on reframing those thoughts to alleviate some of the pressure. Does that approach make sense to you? Would you like to start by discussing any specific expectations you've had?",

    "chosen": "Thank you for sharing that. It seems like there's a belief that you should \"naturally know\" how to meet all of your baby's needs and be a \"good parent\" right away. It's understandable how that expectation could lead to feeling like you're messing up when reality doesn't match. Let's explore this belief further. What are some specific situations where you feel like you're not meeting your expectations? This can help us identify key thoughts to address.",

    "chosen": "This situation sounds really challenging and distressing for you. It's common to feel pressure to have all the answers immediately as a parent, yet every baby is different and often it takes time to learn their signals. Let's work on reframing this thought. What if we looked at it as a learning process rather than an expectation to be perfect right away? How might it feel to consider that it's okay to not have immediate answers, and that you're actively learning each time?",

When you notice these thoughts of failure arising, you could remind yourself that you're learning and doing your best, which is enough. Would that help? We can also discuss a practical strategy or coping method you could use in those moments. What do you think would be most helpful to focus on next?",

    "chosen": "Absolutely, we can work on that. One useful coping strategy is deep breathing or grounding exercises to help manage intense emotions in the moment. Additionally, having a specific phrase or mantra like, \"I'm doing my best, and that's enough,\" can be reassuring.

    "chosen": "Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you're dealing with some very challenging experiences right now. The flashbacks and anxiety must be quite distressing, and turning to alcohol might be giving you some temporary relief, but it might not be a long-term solution. Let's start by setting a goal for today. How about we focus on identifying healthier coping strategies for managing flashbacks and anxiety? I can guide you through some techniques that might help reduce their impact. How does that sound to you?",

One technique we can try is grounding, which can help you stay connected to the present moment when flashbacks occur.

We'll focus on your senses to bring you back to the present moment. To start, take a few deep breaths. Then, look around you and name five things you can see. Once you've done that, focus on four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help shift your attention away from distressing thoughts. Would you like to try this now, and we can discuss how it feels afterward?",

    "chosen": "That\u2019s a good start, and it sounds like you're experiencing some initial benefits from the exercise by shifting your focus away from the flashbacks. With practice, grounding exercises like this can become more effective in redirecting your attention and easing anxiety. Would you like to continue with the next steps by identifying four things you can touch, or would you like to discuss any thoughts or feelings you have about this so far?",

It\u2019s encouraging to hear that you found some value in the exercise. When you feel ready, we can continue with identifying three things you can hear. Taking notice of the sounds around you can further deepen the grounding experience. How are you feeling about this step?",

    "chosen": "Thank you for walking me through that experience. It sounds like a very anxiety-provoking situation. These thoughts about not explaining things well and being judged seem to lead to feelings of self-doubt and worry. Let's take a moment to dissect those automatic thoughts.

It's worth noting that no one expressed criticism, which could suggest that they might have perceived things differently than you did. Let's work on developing more balanced thoughts for the next time you're in a similar situation.

    "chosen": "You\u2019ve done a great job in identifying both sides, Jamie. It\u2019s very common to feel like an intense emotion must mean something is true, even when the evidence doesn\u2019t entirely support it.

Would you be interested in developing a plan to bring these thoughts into perspective when they pop up?",

If you don\u2019t detect any scents immediately, consider those nearby\u2014maybe a cup of coffee or a piece of fruit. 5. **One Thing You Can Taste**: Finally, focus on one thing you can taste.

It's important to recognize that the absence of immediate feedback, like nodding, doesn't necessarily indicate incompetency.

Let's take a moment to try and understand what might be at the root of these feelings of overwhelm and guilt. How does that sound?

It sounds like finding a balance between doing your best and being compassionate with yourself might be helpful here.

    "chosen": "Thank you for sharing that experience. Let's break it down together. It sounds like the trigger was your partner getting closer during that moment on the couch. When your heart started racing, the automatic thought might have been something like \"I need to protect myself\" or \"I might be trapped again,\" linked to your past experiences. Next, let's evaluate that thought. What evidence is there for and against the idea that you might be in danger in that moment with your partner? This will help us start to challenge the automatic thoughts and create a more balanced perspective.",

As a parent, it's natural to feel responsible, but it seems like you're shouldering a lot of blame. Let's explore this together.
